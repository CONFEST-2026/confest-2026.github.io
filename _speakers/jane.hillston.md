atitle: Supporting Older Adults Living Independently
abstract: The ageing population is a worldwide challenge.  The World Health Organisation predicts that by 2030 one in six adults will be aged 60 or above.  Technology is increasingly seen a part of the solution, especially when it can support older adults to remain independent, living in their own homes.  Key to this trend is the embedding of unobtrusive sensors into people’s domestic setting and the deployment of wearables to monitor the physical well-being of individuals. In our work we are aiming to develop a personalised approach that only captures data in settings that the individual is content with, and to analyse the data against their own expectations and goals.  The captured data is used to build a formal model which is verified against personalised “properties” expressed in temporal logic.  Here violations do not signify failure, but rather interesting data points that can trigger conversations with the individuals, their carers and in some cases their medical team.
bio: Jane Hillston is Professor of Quantitative Modelling in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh.  She received a BA in Mathematics from the University of York (UK) in 1985, a MSc in Mathematics from Lehigh University (USA) in 1987 and a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Edinburgh in 1994.  She joined the academic staff in 1995.
Her principal research interests are in formal approaches to modelling the dynamic behaviour of discrete event systems, particularly from the perspective of performance expressed as logical properties. This has included everything from cloud computing, to biological processes, to transport systems in smart cities. Her research has been supported by numerous grants from public funding bodies and industry.  Her current research interests include how technology can be used to support older adults to live independently and monitor their mental and physical well-being.
