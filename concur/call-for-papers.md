# Call for Papers

The International Conference on Concurrency Theory (CONCUR) brings together researchers, developers, and students in order to advance the theory of concurrency and promote its applications.
CONCUR solicits high quality papers reporting research results and/or experience related to semantics, logics, verification and analysis of concurrent systems.

## Important dates

- Abstracts: 20 April, 2026 (AoE)
- Submissions: 27 April, 2026 (AoE)
- Rebuttal: 1 – 3 June, 2026 (AoE)
- Notification: 15 June, 2026 (AoE)
- Camera Ready: 29 June, 2026 (AoE)
- Conference: 1 – 4 September, 2026
- Workshops: 5 September, 2026

## Topics

Submissions are solicited in the theory and practice of concurrent systems. The
principal topics include (but are not limited to):

- **Basic models of concurrency** such as abstract machines, domain-theoretic
models, categorical and coalgebraic models, game-theoretic models, parametric
models, process algebras, graph transformation systems, Petri nets, hybrid
systems, mobile and collaborative systems, probabilistic systems, real-time
systems, quantum systems, biology-inspired systems, and synchronous systems;

- **Logics for concurrency** such as modal logics, program logics, probabilistic
and stochastic logics, temporal logics, multi-agent logics, and resource
logics;

- **Verification and analysis techniques for concurrent systems** such as abstract
interpretation, atomicity checking, model checking, race detection, pre-order
and equivalence checking, run-time verification, state-space exploration,
static analysis, synthesis, testing, theorem proving, type systems, and
security analysis;

- **Distributed/parallel algorithms and concurrent data structures**: design,
analysis, complexity, correctness, fault tolerance, reliability, availability,
consistency, self-organization, self-stabilization, commitment schemes,
communication protocols;

- **Theoretical foundations**, tools, and empirical evaluations of architectures,
execution environments, and software development for concurrent systems such as
geo-replicated systems, distributed ledgers, communication networks,
multiprocessor and multi-core architectures, quantum computing, quantum
communication, shared and transactional memory, resource management and
awareness, compilers and tools for concurrent programming, programming models
such as component-based, object- and service-oriented.

## Paper submission

- All papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere.
- Each paper will undergo a thorough review process.
- Papers must be submitted electronically as PDF files via EasyChair (<https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=concur2026>).
- Proceedings will be published by LIPIcs, please use their style files (<https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/series/LIPIcs#author>) when preparing your submission.
- Submissions follow a single blind process.
- Papers must not exceed 15 pages (excluding references and appendices, LIPIcs style)
- An appendix may provide additional material and proofs, but cannot be expected to be scrutinized by the reviewers and will not be published in the proceedings.
