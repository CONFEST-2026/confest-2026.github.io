# Conference Sustainability

CONFEST 2026 is committed to minimizing our environmental impact and promoting sustainable practices in academic conferences. We are guided by the principles of **TCS4Future**, an initiative within the theoretical computer science community that advocates for environmentally conscious conference organization.

## Our Commitment

As researchers studying complex systems and their optimization, we recognize our responsibility to apply these principles to reduce the carbon footprint of our own events. CONFEST 2026 aims to be a model for sustainable conference practices in the computer science community.

## Green Travel

### Sustainable Transportation
We strongly encourage sustainable travel options:

- **Train Travel**: Liverpool is excellently connected by rail to major European cities
  - Direct trains from London (2h 15min)
  - Easy connections from Paris and Brussels via London
  - Short journey from Manchester (30min) with international airport connections
- **Reduced Flying**: Consider overland alternatives for journeys under 6 hours
- **Carbon Offsetting**: For unavoidable flights, we encourage verified carbon offset programs

### Local Transport
- **Walking**: The University of Liverpool campus is easily walkable from the city center
- **Public Transport**: Excellent local bus and rail connections
- **Cycling**: Liverpool has expanding cycle infrastructure
- **Car Sharing**: Coordinated carpooling for local participants

## Digital-First Approach

### Reducing Paper Waste
- **Digital Proceedings**: All papers available electronically
- **Mobile App**: Conference program and scheduling via smartphone
- **QR Codes**: For session links and material access
- **Digital Posters**: Online poster sessions to reduce printing

### Hybrid Participation
- **Remote Attendance**: Live streaming of keynotes and selected sessions
- **Virtual Networking**: Online spaces for remote participants
- **Digital Q&A**: Interactive participation for remote attendees

## TCS4Future Initiative

**TCS4Future** (Theoretical Computer Science for Future) is a grassroots initiative within the theoretical computer science community focused on making our field more environmentally sustainable. The initiative promotes:

- **Conference Location Planning**: Choosing venues accessible by low-carbon transport
- **Frequency Optimization**: Balancing scientific exchange with travel impact
- **Community Engagement**: Sharing best practices across the TCS community
- **Research Integration**: Connecting sustainability with theoretical computer science research

CONFEST 2026 proudly supports TCS4Future's mission and implements their recommended practices:

### Key TCS4Future Principles We Follow:
1. **Accessibility by Train**: Liverpool's excellent rail connections align with low-carbon travel
2. **Local Sourcing**: Partnering with Liverpool-based suppliers where possible  
3. **Waste Reduction**: Minimizing single-use materials and maximizing digital delivery
4. **Community Building**: Creating lasting connections that reduce need for frequent travel

## Local Sustainability

### University of Liverpool Initiatives
The University of Liverpool, our host institution, has committed to:
- **Carbon Neutrality by 2030**
- **Sustainable Campus Operations**
- **Green Building Standards** for the Central Teaching Hub venue
- **Local Supplier Networks** reducing transport emissions

### Liverpool's Green Infrastructure
- **UNESCO World Heritage** city with sustainable tourism practices
- **Renewable Energy** initiatives across the city
- **Sustainable Food Networks** featuring local produce
- **Green Spaces** and parks integrated throughout the urban environment

## Participant Actions

### Before the Conference
- Choose sustainable travel options where possible
- Consider extending your stay to reduce travel frequency
- Review digital materials rather than printing
- Coordinate travel with colleagues from your institution

### During the Conference
- Use provided reusable water bottles and coffee cups
- Participate in digital networking and Q&A
- Use public transport and walking for local travel
- Support local, sustainable restaurants and venues

### After the Conference
- Share your sustainable travel experiences
- Provide feedback on our green initiatives
- Continue discussions through digital platforms
- Apply learned sustainability practices at your home institution

## Measuring Our Impact

CONFEST 2026 will track and report on:
- **Carbon Footprint**: Total estimated COâ‚‚ emissions from the event
- **Travel Analysis**: Mode of transport breakdown for participants
- **Waste Reduction**: Comparison with traditional conference practices
- **Digital Engagement**: Participation rates in online components

## Future Commitments

We commit to:
- **Transparent Reporting**: Publishing our sustainability metrics post-conference
- **Continuous Improvement**: Incorporating participant feedback for future events
- **Community Sharing**: Contributing our practices to the TCS4Future knowledge base
- **Long-term Impact**: Supporting sustainable practices beyond CONFEST 2026
