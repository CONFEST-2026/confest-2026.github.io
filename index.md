# CONFEST 2026

CONFEST brings together researchers, developers, and students in computer science, in order to advance the theory of concurrency, the study of stochastic and timed systems, and the application of formal methods to industrial systems. 

This umbrella event consists of three main conferences [CONCUR](concur), [FMICS](fmics) and [QEST+FORMATS](qestformats), and affiliated workshops.
The 2026 edition will take place on the main campus of the University of Liverpool, on **September 1-5, 2026**.
