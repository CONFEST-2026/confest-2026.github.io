# QEST + FORMATS

**QEST**, the International Conference on Quantitative Evaluation of SysTems, is the leading forum on evaluation and verification of computer systems and networks, through stochastic models and measurements.

**FORMATS**, the International Conference on Formal Modeling and Analysis of Timed Systems, aims to promote the study of fundamental and practical aspects of timed systems, including modelling, design, and analysis.

In recent years both events have joined up as one. The 2026 event will take place as part of CONFEST 2026.
