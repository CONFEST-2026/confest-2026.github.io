From Manchester, it’s just over half an hour away, and Manchester Airport can be reached in around 1 hour 20 minutes. Birmingham is also conveniently close, with journeys from both the city centre and the airport typically taking under two hours. And from London, fast direct trains make the trip in around two hours fifteen minutes (itself reachable from Paris and Brussels in a little over two hours).

Liverpool Lime Street is the main station in Liverpool (Liverpool Central is the local metro network hub only).
