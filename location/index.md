## Reaching Liverpool

### Trains
We encourage you to consider taking the train!

Liverpool is just 2 hours 20 minutes from London.

Liverpool Lime street is the main station in Liverpool, and is just 15-20 minute walk to the campus (up a slight hill).

Liverpool Central station is the hub for the metro network for local commuters; Liverpool Lime street is typically the station you need.

### Airports

- Liverpool: You can take buses 500, 86, 80A and 82A to Liverpool city centre (500 being the fastest). Alternatively you can take a bus to Liverpool South Parkway and take the <a href="https://www.merseyrail.org/">Merseyrail</a> service to Liverpool Central.
- Manchester: A train service runs between Manchester Airport and Liverpool Lime Street station. There is also a <a href="nationalexpress.com"> direct coach service</a> which takes about 1 hour.
